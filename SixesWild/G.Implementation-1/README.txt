Hello!
There should be 2 run-able jar files.
LevelBuilderMock1.jar will run the level builder GUI, but only the New Level option works.
SixesWildMock1.jar will run all but the achievements and any level after 1. Also, the game WORKS, so feel free to test it out.
Respectfully submitted,
Nathaniel Mahowald, Liz Miller, Alex Bittle, William Moore, and Sean McCrone.
